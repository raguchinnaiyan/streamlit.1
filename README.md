I have conducted an analysis of Retail Order Data to assess sales performance by identifying key trends, top-performing products, and growth opportunities using a dataset of sales transactions. I have identified 20 key business insights to enhance sales performance. These insights were created in an SQL database and visualized with the help of Streamlit.

Documents:
The uploaded documents have been cleaned for null values, and additional columns have been added for calculations. SA1 and SA2 are used for JOIN queries in SQL with the help of primary and foreign keys.

The Retail_Order_Data_Analysis.py file has been uploaded for reference, and it contains the complete code used to build the Streamlit report.

These are the 20 business insights that havebeen taken for analyzing sales performance:
1.What are the top 10 highest revenue-generating products?
2.Which are the top 5 cities with the highest profit margins?
3.How much total discount has been given for each category?
4.What is the average sale price per product category?
5.Which region has the highest average sale price?
6.What is the total profit per category?
7.Which are the top 3 segments with the highest quantity of orders?
8.What is the average discount percentage given per region?
9.Which product category has the highest total profit?
10.How much total revenue has been generated per year?

11.What is the total number of orders placed per segment?
12.Which are the high-profit margin products (profit margin > 30%)?
13.How much total discount has been given per region?
14.What are the top 10 products ranked by total revenue?
15.How many total products were sold per year?
16.Which product category is ordered most frequently?
17.What is the average order value per region?
